### README.md
 - THIS REPO IS OUTDATED, ABANDONED, AND MAINLY USED FOR FREE ONLINE STORAGE.
 - I was once intrested in old iOS jailbreak, and was creating a repo for my old iDevices with random old and probably pirated tweaks. In the meantime, I lost all intrest in the jailbreaking community, and started working on something else.

## 🗄 My OUTDATED projects
