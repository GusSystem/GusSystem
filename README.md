### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - My name is Gus, and I am a 14-yo stupid kid, who just wants to have fun :)
 - I am currently intrested in old iOS jailbreak, and I am creating a repo for my old iDevices !
 - I use an iPhone 8, own an iPhone 5s (which does not work anymore, RIP), an iPhone 4s and an iPad 2. I work on a Mid 2012 MacBook Pro (still good !) and broke an early 2015 MacBook Air by trying to fix it.
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: @GusSystem on Twitter, Gus#4064 on Discord ! (These socials are subject to change, I'll update whenever I can)
 
## ðŸ—„ My projects
I made some Projects wich I am proud of, and here they are :) 
- [My iOS Repo](https://github.com/GusSystem/repo) 
- [The iOS 13 Dynamic wallpapers](https://github.com/GusSystem/iOS13-Dynamic-Wallpapers-for-macOS) 
- [My own Linux Post-Install script](https://github.com/GusSystem/linuxpostinstallscript) 

The iOS Repo is now working ! I learnt how Silica works, and now It is up and running. Thanks to iCraze for the test :)
The wallpapers are the iOS 13 wallpapers, but for macOS. Dynamic versions !
The Linux Post-Install script allows me to install all my software when I install Linux, in one click. It does not work currently, and I need to update it for newest versions of Ubuntu.
