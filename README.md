### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 - I am currently intrested in old iOS jailbreak, and I am (trying to) creating a repo for my old iDevices !
 - I own an iPhone 5s, an iPhone 4s and an iPad 2. I work on a MacBook Pro mid 2012 (still good !)
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: @GusSystem on Twitter, Gus#6969 on Discord ! (may change tho)

## ðŸ—„ My projects
I made some Projects wich I am proud of, and here they are :) 
- [My iOS Repo !] (https://github.com/GusSystem/repo) It doesn't completly work at the moment, but I am sure I will find some time (and motivation!) to fix it.
- [The iOS 13 Dynamic wallpapers.] (https://github.com/GusSystem/iOS13-Dynamic-Wallpapers-for-macOS) Those are the iOS 13's wallpapers, but for macOS. Dynamic versions !
- [My own Linux Post-Install script.] (https://github.com/GusSystem/linuxpostinstallscript) This script allows me to install all my desired software when I install Linux.
