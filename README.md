### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - My name is Gus, and I am a 17-yo stupid kid. THIS REPO IS OUTDATED, ABANDONED, AND MAINLY USED FOR FREE ONLINE STORAGE.
 - I was  intrested in old iOS jailbreak, and was creating a repo for my old iDevices with random old and probably pirated tweaks. In the meantime, I lost all intrest in the jailbreaking community, and started working on something else.
 - I use an iPhone 13 Pro, a mid 2015 MacBook Pro, and bricked an early 2015 MacBook Air's EFI.
 
## ðŸ—„ My OUTDATED projects
These are OLD AND OUTDATED projects. They don't need any of your attention.
