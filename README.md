### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - My name is Gus, and I am a 13-yo kid, who just wants to have fun :)
 - I am currently intrested in old iOS jailbreak, and I am (trying to) creating a repo for my old iDevices !
 - I own an iPhone 5s, an iPhone 4s and an iPad 2. I work on a MacBook Pro mid 2012 (still good !)
 - ðŸ“« How to reach me: @GusSystem on Twitter, Gus#6969 on Discord ! (may change tho)
 - âš¡ Fun fact: If you write Fun Fact, the people will read the thing entirely.
 
## ðŸ—„ My projects
I made some Projects wich I am proud of, and here they are :) 
- [My iOS Repo] (https://github.com/GusSystem/repo) 
- [The iOS 13 Dynamic wallpapers] (https://github.com/GusSystem/iOS13-Dynamic-Wallpapers-for-macOS) 
- [My own Linux Post-Install script] (https://github.com/GusSystem/linuxpostinstallscript) 

The iOS Repo doesn't completly work at the moment, but I am sure I will find some time (and motivation!) to fix it.
The wallpapers are the iOS 13 wallpapers, but for macOS. Dynamic versions !
The Linux Post-Install script allows me to install all my software when I install Linux, in one click.
